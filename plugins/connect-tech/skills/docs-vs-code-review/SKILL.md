# Docs vs. Code Review

Your job is to find where the documentation is wrong or incomplete, then produce a concise list
of specific edits to make. **Only report things that need to change** — skip anything that's
already accurate. The output should read like a focused edit list, not a code audit.

## What you need from the user

You only need:
1. **Confluence page URL** — the root documentation page to review

**GitHub repos are inferred automatically from the Confluence space — do not ask the user for them.**

| Confluence space | Repos to clone and check |
|---|---|
| `connectpublic` or `connect` | `https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-connect` (web/backend) AND `https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-android` (mobile) |
| `commcare` or `CC` | `https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq` |

If the space doesn't match any of the above, then ask the user for the repo URL before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: Fetch the root page AND every child page

Get the Atlassian cloud ID using `getAccessibleAtlassianResources`.

Extract the **page ID** from the URL (the number in the path, e.g. `3215458305`).

Then fetch everything under the root:
- `getConfluencePage(pageId, contentFormat="markdown")` — root page
- `getConfluencePageDescendants(pageId, limit=50)` — find all child pages
- `getConfluencePage` for **each child page** — read them all

This is important: the user wants every page under the root reviewed, not just the root page itself. Make a list of all pages you've fetched before moving to the code, so you can systematically check each one.

As you read, note the specific claims each page makes — exact error messages, column names, icon descriptions, navigation steps, character limits, permission rules, and what happens when an action is taken.

---

## Step 2: Clone and read the relevant code

Using the repos inferred from the Confluence space (see table above), clone shallowly:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ORG/REPO.git /tmp/REPO
```

Find files that implement the documented features. The most useful files to check:

| File | What to look for |
|------|-----------------|
| `models.py` | Field names, `max_length`, status choices, defaults |
| `views.py` | Navigation after actions, permission decorators, side effects |
| `forms.py` | Validation logic, exact error message strings |
| `tasks.py` | SMS/push notification content |
| `tables.py` | Column labels, icon CSS classes (especially color), tooltip text |
| Import files (`visit_import.py` etc.) | Exact required CSV column names — often wrong in docs |
| `utils/flags.py` | Flag string identifiers |

Use grep to find specific behavior across all cloned repos:
```bash
grep -rn "term" /tmp/REPO --include="*.py" | grep -v migration | grep -v test
# For mobile (commcare-android), also check .kt and .java files:
grep -rn "term" /tmp/commcare-android --include="*.kt" --include="*.java"
```

Common gotchas worth checking on every review:
- **CSV import column names**: check the actual constant values, not display labels (e.g., `AMOUNT_COL = "payment amount"`, not `"Amount"`)
- **Icon colors**: search for CSS class (e.g., is it `text-orange-600` or `text-red-600`?)
- **SMS/notification content**: find the actual template string
- **Status values**: check the `TextChoices` class for real string values
- **Rate limits**: search `timedelta` near the relevant view
- **Revoke/undo actions**: what fields are actually cleared vs. retained?
- **"Not found" re-check logic**: does the code retry before giving up, vs. what the docs imply?

## Step 3: Produce the edit list

For each page you reviewed, report only the things that need to change. Skip anything correct.

Structure the output as two sections:

### Section A — Inaccurate or Misleading Content

Things where the docs say something wrong or incomplete compared to the code. Order by severity — break things first, then confusing things, then minor wording issues.

Use this format for each item:

---
**[High/Medium/Low] Page: [Page name] — [Short title of issue]**

> [Quote the exact text that's wrong]

Change to: [Exact replacement text, or clear description of what to add/remove]

*(Code: `file.py` — one-line explanation of what the code actually does)*

---

Keep it tight. The code reference is just enough to justify the change — a filename and one sentence, not a walkthrough. Don't explain what you checked and found to be correct.

### Section B — Documentation Quality Gaps

For pages missing required sections per the [Connect Documentation Process](https://dimagi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/connect/pages/3092250699/Connect+Documentation+Process). Be brief — one line per gap.

Required sections each page should have: Feature Summary, Usage Overview, Screenshots with accompanying text (the support bot can't read images), Behavior Details/Edge Cases, Version & Last Updated Date.

Best practices to flag if missing:
- No info panel at top explaining purpose and user personas
- Screenshots without text descriptions (support bot can't interpret images)
- No step-by-step instructions
- No FAQs for complex features

Format: `**Page: [Name]** — Missing: [list what's absent]. Recommendation: [one sentence]`

---

## Scope

Cover every page under the root. If you find more than ~10 items in Section A, prioritize the ones that would cause a user to do something wrong (wrong column names, wrong navigation, wrong constraints) over minor wording issues.
