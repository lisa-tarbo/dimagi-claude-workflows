# Add Android String Resource

## Overview

Add a new `<string>` entry to all locale `strings.xml` files in the CommCare Android project, given a resource name and English text.

## Discovering Locales

The English source lives at `app/res/values/strings.xml`. Translated locales live in sibling directories matching `app/res/values-*/strings.xml` (e.g., `values-es`, `values-fr`). Always enumerate the current set at runtime — do not assume a fixed list, since locales may be added or removed over time.

Run this to list every locale `strings.xml` file:

```bash
ls app/res/values*/strings.xml
```

The directory suffix after `values-` is the BCP 47 / Android locale code (e.g., `es` = Spanish, `fr` = French, `pt` = Portuguese). Translate accordingly.

## Workflow

1. **Enumerate locales:** Run the `ls` command above to get the full current set of locale files.
2. **Locate insertion point:** Grep for a nearby existing string with a similar prefix in `values/strings.xml` to find the right neighborhood. Place the new string near related entries.
3. **Read context around insertion point** in each locale file (the same neighboring strings may appear at different line numbers per locale).
4. **Add the English string** to `values/strings.xml`.
5. **Translate and add** to every other locale file discovered in step 1. Translate the English text into each language, matching the tone and style of surrounding strings in that file.
6. **Every locale gets the string** — do not skip any locale, even ones that have fewer existing strings.

## Format

```xml
<string name="resource_name">Translated text here</string>
```

- Escape apostrophes with `\'` in XML.
- Preserve any `%d`, `%s`, or other format specifiers exactly as in the English source.

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping locales that have fewer translated strings — always include every locale returned by the discovery step, regardless of how sparse the file is.
- Hard-coding a list of locales from memory instead of running the discovery command — the set of supported locales changes over time.
- Placing the string at the end of the file instead of near related strings.
- Forgetting to escape special XML characters in translations.
